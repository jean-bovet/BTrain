/// This class implements the path resolving algorithm for a given graph.
///
/// It works by taking in an unresolved path, that is, a path with missing or unspecified
/// node that need to be filled to get a path with continuous nodes.
///
/// For example, a user can build a route with a starting and ending station and only one block,
/// leaving all the other blocks unspecified. The role of this algorithm is to find these unspecified blocks

    /// For example:
    /// "Station A" > "Block D" > "Station B"

    /// For example, Station A has two blocks, A1 and A2. A1 can be used in both direction, so both (A1,next) and (A1,previous)
    /// is returned. This leads to the following possibilities (only 2 are shown):
    /// - (A1,next) (D,next) (B1,next): this path is valid
    /// - (A1,previous) (D,next) (B1,next): this path is invalid because the train cannot go from (A1,previous) to (D,next)
