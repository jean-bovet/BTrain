/// This class resolves an arbitrary route by finding all the missing elements, turnouts or blocks, that are not explicitely specified in the route.
///
/// A route consists of one or more steps. Each step defines a turnout or a block that the train needs to follow. The steps of a route do not
/// necessarily contain contiguous turnout or block. For example, the user can create a route with just a few blocks specified and it will be up
/// to this class to find out the missing turnouts (and blocks) to create a contiguous route.
///
/// Note: a train must be specified in order to resolve the steps because a train can have specific requirements
/// to avoid certain blocks or turnouts, in addition to the algorithm checking allowing block (or turnout)
/// already reserved for the same train to be accepted as resolved steps.
