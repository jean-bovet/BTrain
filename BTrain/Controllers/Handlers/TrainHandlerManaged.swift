/**
 Manages the operation of a single train in the layout.
 
 When BTrain manages a train, it must ensure the train starts, stops
 and brakes appropriately to avoid collision with other trains and respect
 the constraints of the layout while following the indication of the route
 assigned to the train. BTrain does this by responding to events from the layout,
 such as ``TrainEvent/feedbackTriggered`` when a feedback is triggered
 in the layout indicating a train is passing over the feedback.
 
 There are two kinds of routes:
 
 *Manual Route*
 
 A manual route is created manually by the user and does not change when the train is running. This controller ensures the train follows the manual route
 and stops the train if the block(s) ahead cannot be reserved. The train is restarted when the block(s) ahead can be reserved again.
 
 *Automatic Route*
 
 An automatic route is created and managed automatically by BTrain:
 - An automatic route is created each time a train starts
 - An automatic route is updated when the train moves into a new block and the block(s) ahead cannot be reserved
 
 An automatic route is created using the following rules:
 - If there is a destination defined (ie the user as specified to which block the train should move to), the automatic route is created using the shortest path algorithm.
 - If there are no destination specified, BTrain finds a random route from the train position until a station block is found. During the search, block or turnout that
 should be avoided will be ignored. However, elements reserved for other trains will be taken into account because the reservations
 will change as the trains move in the layout.
